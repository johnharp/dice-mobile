I have developed a fair amount of React both at work and in home projects
and I wanted to try out React Native.

I have taken courses from [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) in the past so I assumed his
React Native course would be high-quality as well:

[React Native: The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide)

From it I learned the following a few things:

* How to handle page navigation
* The basics of Flexbox
* Differences between React and React Native
* And some Blender 3D modeling knowledge:
  - how to do UV unwrapping for the dice models
